Justification of Risk Indicators::::::
1. Total Value in USD
Larger wallets typically have higher resilience and better ability to manage liquidation risks.
However, very high-value wallets may use complex strategies, so scaling neutralizes extreme outliers.

2. Protocol Count
A moderate number of protocols indicates healthy diversification.
Too few protocols → dependency risk on a single platform.
Too many protocols → operational risk due to complexity.

3.Activity Score
Inactive wallets may be abandoned or at risk of sudden reactivation/liquidity drain.
Highly active wallets may be engaging in speculative or risky behavior.

These indicators give a balanced, holistic view of a wallet’s risk by combining financial strength, diversification, and behavioral patterns.
